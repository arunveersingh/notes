in progress notes:

The `spring-jcl` library plays a crucial role in the Spring Framework's logging infrastructure:

- **Logging Bridge**: `spring-jcl` acts as a bridge between the Spring Framework and various logging frameworks. It is essentially Spring's custom implementation of the Apache Commons Logging (JCL - Jakarta Commons Logging) API. This bridge allows Spring to use different logging frameworks like Log4J, Logback, or even the JDK's `java.util.logging` without needing additional bridge libraries.

- **Dependency**: Every Spring module depends on `spring-core`, which in turn depends on `spring-jcl`. This ensures that all parts of Spring use the same logging mechanism, facilitating easier migration and maintaining backward compatibility across different versions of Spring. If you're using a build tool like Maven, you'll notice that `commons-logging` dependency comes from `spring-core` due to this hierarchy.

- **Default Behavior**: When no other logging framework is specified or available in the classpath, `spring-jcl` falls back to using `java.util.logging` (JUL). This makes it very convenient for developers as it provides logging capabilities out-of-the-box without requiring additional configurations or dependencies.

- **Integration with Other Logging Frameworks**: 
  - If Log4j 2 or SLF4J is present in the classpath, `spring-jcl` detects them and routes logging calls accordingly. This means that if you include Log4j 2 or SLF4J in your project, Spring will automatically use these for logging without any additional setup.
  - For SLF4J, you would typically exclude the `commons-logging` dependency from Spring and use `jcl-over-slf4j` to route Spring's JCL calls to SLF4J, which can then be configured to use any SLF4J binding like Logback, Log4j2, etc.

- **Conflict Avoidance**: There can be conflicts if both `spring-jcl` and `commons-logging` are on the classpath, especially in environments like IBM Websphere where JCL implementations might be provided by the container. In such cases, developers might exclude `commons-logging` and rely solely on `spring-jcl` or use SLF4J as an intermediary.

- **Usage in Spring Applications**: When you use Spring Boot or Spring Framework, `spring-jcl` is included implicitly through the `spring-boot-starter-logging` which is part of many Spring Boot starters. This ensures that logging is configured and works out-of-the-box with the chosen logging framework.

In essence, `spring-jcl` ensures that Spring applications have a consistent and flexible logging setup, adapting to whatever logging framework is available or preferred by the developer or dictated by the environment.


In a Spring Boot application configured to use Logback by default, `spring-jcl` still plays a significant role behind the scenes:

1. **Integration Layer**:
   - **Spring Boot** uses `spring-jcl` to provide a consistent logging abstraction. Even though Spring Boot applications are configured by default to use Logback for logging, `spring-jcl` is there to ensure compatibility with Spring's logging requirements. It serves as a bridge between Spring's logging needs and whatever logging framework you decide to use, including Logback.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - When you include a Spring Boot starter like `spring-boot-starter`, it brings in `spring-boot-starter-logging`, which includes Logback by default. However, `spring-boot-starter-logging` also includes `spring-jcl` indirectly through dependencies like `spring-core`. This ensures that:
     - Spring's internal logging calls go through `spring-jcl`, which then forwards these to Logback because Logback is on the classpath.

3. **Default Configuration**:
   - `spring-jcl` is designed to detect the presence of various logging frameworks. In this case:
     - Since Logback is present (and is the default logging framework for Spring Boot), `spring-jcl` automatically routes all logging requests to Logback without any additional configuration needed from the developer.

4. **Fallback and Compatibility**:
   - If for some reason Logback were not on the classpath or if there was a conflict with another logging framework, `spring-jcl` would fall back to using `java.util.logging` or another detected framework. However, in a standard Spring Boot setup with Logback, this fallback mechanism isn't typically needed.

5. **Logging Abstraction**:
   - Even with Logback in place, `spring-jcl` provides an abstraction layer. This means developers can write logging statements in Spring's code without worrying about the underlying logging implementation. This abstraction allows for easier switching between logging frameworks if needed in the future.

6. **Classpath Scanning**:
   - `spring-jcl` performs classpath scanning to detect available logging frameworks. When it finds Logback, it initializes Spring's logging system to use Logback's capabilities.

In summary, when using Spring Boot with Logback, `spring-jcl` ensures that:
- Spring's internal logging is seamlessly integrated with Logback.
- The application benefits from Spring's logging abstraction, allowing for consistency and potential future changes in logging strategy with minimal impact on existing code.
- You get the benefits of Logback's configuration, performance, and features while maintaining the flexibility provided by `spring-jcl`. 

Thus, even though Logback is doing the actual logging, `spring-jcl` is crucial for the integration and abstraction within Spring Boot's ecosystem.
